  <h1 style="color:Purple;">Crystals!</h1>
  
<h3 style="color:Purple;">A crystal has atoms that are arranged in an organized structure. <br>
The number and strength of the bonds with adjoining atoms makes the crystals hard or soft. <br>
Crystals grow into a specific geometric pattern, enclosed by flat surfaces known as crystal faces. <br>
Crystallographers are scientists who study crystals. <br>
  The idea is that crystals interact with the body's energy field, creating balance and alignment. <br>
  Many people use crystals for stress and focus, <br>
  while others believe that crystals have the power to heal physical ailments and illnesses. <br>

<h3> Hello! I absolutely love crystals, don't you? <br>
   They come in many diffrent shapes and sizes and have unique names. There are also birthstone crystals. <br>
  I was born in april so my crystal is a diamond/ crystal quartz. </h3> <br>

  <h1> Crystal Facts </h1> <br>

<h2>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>
  <h2> 10 fun facts about crystals that you didn't know! </h2>
  <h2> 1- </h2> <br> It’s all about the rhythm: Crystals are repeating, three-dimensional arrangements of atoms, ions, or molecules. <br>

  <h2>2-</h2><br> Almost any solid material can crystallize—even DNA. Chemists from New York University, Purdue University, and the Argonne National Laboratory recently created DNA crystals large enough to see with the naked eye. The work could have applications in nanoelectronics and drug development. <br>

  <h2>3-</h2><br> One thing that is not a crystal: leaded “crystal” glass, like the vases that so many newlyweds dread. (Glass consists of atoms or molecules all in a jumble, not in the well-patterned order that defines a crystal.) <br>

  <h2>4-</h2> <br> The oldest known pieces of our planet’s surface are 4.4-billion-year-old zircon crystals from the Jack Hills of western Australia. <br>

  <h2>5-</h2> <br> The center of the earth was once thought to be a single, 1,500-mile-wide iron crystal. Seismic studies now show that the inner core is not a single solid but perhaps an aggregate of smaller crystals. <br>

  <h2>6-</h2><br> Tiny silicate crystals, which need high temperatures to form, have been found inside icy comets from the solar system’s distant, chilly edges. Powerful flares from the sun may have provided the necessary heat. <br

<h2>7-</h2><br> In Chihuahua, Mexico, a limestone cavern 1,000 feet below the surface contains the largest crystals in the world: glittering gypsum formations up to 6 feet in diameter and 36 feet long, weighing as much as 55 tons. <br>

  <h2>8- </h2><br> You may be sitting in a gypsum cave right now: It is a primary component of drywall.

  <h2>9- </h2><br>Are the streets of New York paved with gold? No, but the bedrock schist beneath them is studded with opal, beryl, chrysoberyl, garnet, and three kinds of tourmaline. <br>

  <h2>10- </h2><br> In 1885 a garnet weighing nearly 10 pounds was discovered beneath 35th Street near Broadway, close to today’s Macy’s store. According to urban lore, it was unearthed either during subway construction or by a laborer digging a sewer. <br>
